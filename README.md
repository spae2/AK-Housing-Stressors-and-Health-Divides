# AK-Housing-Stressors-and-Health-Divides
Geographic distribution maps highlighting the stressful housing environments, preventable fatalities, and the impact of reduced funding to prevention programs.

Part 1 of the code is to highlight the distribution of severe housing issues across Alaska from 2021-2023, caused both by both climate and socioeconomic environment.

Part 2 is to spotlight how these severe housing issues caused by environmental factors & socioeconomic stressors impact the population through preventable fatalities.

These visuals are to showcase the importance of intervention for substance abuse & housing resources, and to encourage allocating funding for prevention programs & shelters.
